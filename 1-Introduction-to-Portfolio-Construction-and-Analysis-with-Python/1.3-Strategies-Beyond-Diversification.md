## Constraints of Portfolio Diversification

- **Elements that diversification successfully addresses**:

  - The approach to augment the reward for each unit of risk;
  - The method to reduce idiosyncratic or specific risk: indeed, it enables investors to diminish specific risks within their portfolios, which is how they can achieve a high reward for each unit of risk.

- **Elements that diversification fails to address**:

  - Diversification is not a viable strategy to reduce systemic risk: essentially, if the entire market collapses, the degree of portfolio diversification becomes irrelevant as correlation levels typically rise and the benefits of diversification diminish.

Subsequently, the intent is to illustrate the aforementioned aspect, specifically that during significant financial downturns, portfolio diversification does not ensure reduced risk.

Proceed to load the subsequent dataset featuring 30 Industry portfolios from Kaggle:

```python
nind = 30

ind_rets   = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="rets", nind=nind)  # Retrieving industry returns
ind_nfirms = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="nfirms", nind=nind)  # Accessing the number of firms per industry
ind_size   = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="size", nind=nind)  # Gathering average industry sizes

ind_rets.head(3)  # Displaying the first three entries of industry returns
```

The **`ind_rets`** dataframe encompasses returns (spanning 1926-2018) of $30$ portfolios covering various industry sectors such as food, beer, smoke, etc.

These portfolios are formulated based on weights corresponding to their market capitalizations.
The **`market capitalization`** of an entity is its **`total valuation`**, calculated as
the product of the company's outstanding share count and the share price
(e.g., if company "A" has 100,000 shares at $20.3 each, its market cap is $2,030,000).

For instance, the **`Food`** column represents the returns of a portfolio comprising all companies within the food sector for each month from 1926 to 2019. Each company is weighted according to its market capitalization within this portfolio.

Next, the **`number of firms`** comprising each individual sector is recorded in **`ind_nfirms`**:

```python
ind_nfirms.head(3)
```

indicating that in July 1926, there were 43 companies in the Food portfolio, 3 in the Beer portfolio, etc.

Lastly, the **`ind_size`** dataframe presents the **`average size`** of the companies within each portfolio:

```python
ind_size.head(3)
```

illustrating that the average size of the 43 Food companies in July 1926 was 35.98, while the average size of the 3 Beer companies was 7.12, and so on (the unit of measurement is arbitrary). Here, **`average size`** refers to the **`mean of the market capitalizations`** of the companies within sectors like Food, Beer, etc.

### Formulating the Index

The initial step is to calculate the **`market capitalization for each industry sector`**.
This is determined by multiplying the number of firms by their average size:

```python
# Calculate the market capitalization for each sector
ind_mkt_cap = ind_nfirms * ind_size
print(ind_mkt_cap.head(3))
```

The next objective is to ascertain the **`total market capitalization`** to derive the proportion of the
total market capitalization attributed to each industry. The total market capitalization
is a singular time series **`indicating the aggregate market value at each month`**.
This is achieved by summing the market capitalization of each sector for every month, i.e.,
by horizontally summing the **`ind_mkt_cap`**:

```python
# Summing across sectors to get the total market capitalization at each time point
total_mkt_cap = ind_mkt_cap.sum(axis=1)
print(total_mkt_cap.head())
```

Then, the proportion of each industry's market cap to the total can be calculated:

```python
# Calculating the weight of each industry's market cap in the total market capitalization
ind_cap_weights = ind_mkt_cap.divide(total_mkt_cap, axis=0)
print(ind_cap_weights.head(3))
```

For instance, in July 1926, the total market capitalization was $\$26,657.94$, with the Food sector comprising approximately $5.8\%$,
the Beer sector approximately $0.08\%$, and so forth.

Visualization of these components is as follows:

```python
# Creating plots to visualize the total market capitalization and the weights of selected sectors over time
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,4)) 
total_mkt_cap.plot(grid=True, ax=ax[0]) 
ax[0].set_title("Total market cap 1929-2018")

ind_cap_weights[["Steel","Fin","Telcm"]].plot(grid=True, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title("Steel, Finance, and Telecommunication Market caps (%) 1929-2018")
plt.show()
```

The left plot displays the total market capitalization from 1929 to 2018. The right plot shows the Steel, Finance, and Telecommunication Market
caps from 1929 to 2018 as a percentage of the total market capitalization.

For instance, observe the change in the Finance sector from about $3%$ of the total market cap in 1929 to over $15%$ in 2018.
Conversely, the Steel sector decreased from around $9%$ in 1929 to $0.2%$ in 2018.

Now, the focus shifts to calculating the **`total market return`**, i.e., the return time series for the total market.
This is the sum of the weighted returns of each sector:

```python
# Calculating the total market return by weighting each sector's monthly returns
total_market_return = (ind_cap_weights * ind_rets).sum(axis=1)

# Assuming an initial investment of 1000$
capital = 1000
# Compounding the returns to get the total market index
total_market_index = capital * (1 + total_market_return).cumprod()

# Visualizing the total market index and returns over time
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,4)) 

total_market_index.plot(grid=True, ax=ax[0]) 
ax[0].set_title("Total market cap-weighted index 1929-2018")

total_market_return.plot(grid=True, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title("Total market cap-weighted returns 1929-2018")

plt.show()
```

Note that the plot of the (cap-weighted) index essentially mirrors the plot of the total market capitalization, albeit with different values.

Finally, the aim is to explore **`the relationship between returns and market correlations`**.

### Analyzing Rolling Returns

This section plots the total market index from 1990 onwards, alongside several moving average (MA) series corresponding to 60, 36, and 12 months, respectively. This aims to demonstrate how the **`.rolling`** method functions in Python.

```python
# Plotting the total market cap-weighted index from 1990 onwards
total_market_index["1990":].plot(grid=True, figsize=(11,6), label="Total market cap-weighted index")

# Plotting moving averages over different window sizes to observe trends over time
total_market_index["1990":].rolling(window=60).mean().plot(grid=True, figsize=(11,6), label="60 months MA")  # 5 years MA
total_market_index["1990":].rolling(window=36).mean().plot(grid=True, figsize=(11,6), label="36 months MA")  # 3 years MA
total_market_index["1990":].rolling(window=12).mean().plot(grid=True, figsize=(11,6), label="12 months MA")  # 1 year MA

plt.legend()  # Adding legend to the plot
plt.show()  # Displaying the plot
```

Next, the trailing 36 months compound returns of the total market return are computed. This is done by opening a rolling window for 36 months and, for each window, compounding the returns using **`.aggregate`**.

```python
# Calculating trailing 36 months compound returns of total market return
tmi_trail_36_rets = total_market_return.rolling(window=36).aggregate(pok.annualize_rets, periods_per_year=12)

# Plotting the original total market returns alongside the trailing 36 months compound returns
total_market_return.plot(grid=True, figsize=(12,5), label="Total market (monthly) return")
tmi_trail_36_rets.plot(grid=True, figsize=(12,5), label="Trailing 36 months total market compound return")
plt.legend()  # Adding legend to the plot
plt.show()  # Displaying the plot
```

### Calculating Rolling Correlations: Multi-Indices and Groupby

The rolling correlations across industries are computed similarly to the trailing 36 months compound returns, using the **`.corr()`** method for pairwise correlation between columns of the dataframe.

```python
# Computing rolling correlations across industries
rets_trail_36_corr = ind_rets.rolling(window=36).corr()
rets_trail_36_corr.index.names = ["date","industry"]  # Naming the indices for clarity
rets_trail_36_corr.tail()  # Displaying the last few entries
```

The resulting dataframe is a time series of correlation matrices. Each matrix represents the trailing 36 months correlation matrix of compounded returns of the industries for each available data. The structure of the dataframe includes a double index: for each index date, there is a set of index industries.

To observe the averages of all these correlation matrices for each date, group by date and then take the average.

```python
# Calculating the average of all correlation matrices for each date
ind_trail_36_corr = rets_trail_36_corr.groupby(level="date").apply(lambda corrmat: corrmat.values.mean())
```

Plotting the trailing 36 months total market compound return alongside the trailing 36 months total market return correlations provides insights into the relationship between returns and correlations over time.

```python
# Plotting the trailing 36 months total market compound return and correlations
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(14,6))

tmi_trail_36_rets.plot(ax=ax1, color="blue", grid=True, label="Trailing 36 months total market compound return")
ax2 = ax1.twinx()  # Creating a second y-axis
ind_trail_36_corr.plot(ax=ax2, color="orange", grid=True, label="Trailing 36 months total market return correlations")

ax1.set_ylabel('trail 36mo returns')  # Labeling the y-axis
ax2.set_ylabel('trail 36mo corrs',rotation=-90)  # Labeling the second y-axis
ax1.legend(loc=2)  # Positioning the first legend
ax2.legend(loc=1)  # Positioning the second legend
plt.show()  # Displaying the plot
```

Finally, calculate the correlation between the series of (trailing 36 months) compounded returns and the series of average correlations across industries.

```python
# Calculating the correlation between compounded returns and average correlations across industries
tmi_trail_36_rets.corr(ind_trail_36_corr)
```

This correlation is expected to be negative, indicating that as returns fall (especially during market downturns), the average correlation between industries tends to increase, highlighting the limits of diversification during market crashes. Conversely, during periods of market recovery or stability, correlations may decrease, potentially offering more benefits from diversification.

## Strategies for Risk Mitigation

Recent market downturns have underscored the importance of strategies designed for risk control, notably those providing protection against downside risks. This document discusses a fundamental risk insurance strategy before proceeding to more advanced strategies aimed at maximizing upside potential while imposing strict limits on portfolio drawdown.

### Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)

The **`CPPI`** method enables the realization of option-like (convex) payoffs without the actual use of options.

**Two asset classes are typically involved**: a **`risky asset`**, such as equities or mutual funds, and a **`conservative asset`**, typically cash or treasury bonds.

The strategy revolves around **`dynamic allocation`** between the risky and the safe asset, with the allocation percentage for each dependent on the so-called **`cushion value`**, which is the **`current portfolio value`** minus a predetermined **`floor value`**. Essentially, the cushion is a buffer representing a portion of the current portfolio value that one aims to protect from losses.

**In detail**: the amount allocated to a risky asset is **`a positive integer`** $m$ **`times the cushion`**, while the remainder is allocated to the safe asset. Notably, if the cushion diminishes to zero over time, meaning the portfolio is nearing the floor value, the allocation to the risky asset also drops to zero, effectively shifting the entire capital to the safe asset.

**Example**: Consider an investment in a risky asset with $m=4$ and a floor at $90%$ of the portfolio. The allocation would then be $4*(1-0.9)\% = 40\%$ of the total capital to the risky asset, with the remaining $60\%$ to the safe asset.

#### Risky Asset Allocation

Let $A$ represent the portfolio's value, termed the account value. The allocation to the risky asset is then given by:

$$
E := m (A-F) = m A (1 - f),
$$

where $F:=fA$ denotes the **`floor value`**, with $f$ representing the proportion of wealth one wishes to preserve (e.g., $0.9$ in the prior example).

The **`multiplier`** $m$ **`is typically selected based on the acceptable drop in value`**. For instance, if $F$ is the floor value and $E$ is the amount invested in the risky asset, consider a scenario where the risky asset value decreases by $d%$. **`What should be the value of $m$ to ensure the floor isn't breached?`**

One seeks to satisfy:

$$
\text{account}-\text{loss} = A - dE \geq F = \text{floor value},
$$

where $dE$ is the loss from the risky asset investment and $F$ is the floor value. Substituting, one gets:

$$
A - dmA(1-f) \geq fA
$$

leading to:

$$
1 - dm(1-f) \geq f 
\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad
m \leq \frac{1}{d}.
$$

This indicates that if $m$ is chosen to be less or equal to $1/d$, the floor will not be breached.

If $m = 1/d$, the account value after the loss equals the floor value, suggesting the entire loss has been absorbed, and the floor has been reached, following:

$$
\text{account}-\text{loss} = A - dE = A - d\frac{1}{d}A(1-f) = fA = \text{floor value},
$$

Selecting $m=6$, for instance, would mean a loss greater than $20\%$ could breach the floor with such a drop.

**Example**: For a $20\%$ drop,

$$
m \leq \frac{1}{0.2} = 5,
$$

meaning the multiplier should ideally be no more than $5$ to avoid breaching the floor.

Generally, if $m%$ is the maximum acceptable loss, then the multiplier should be (at most) $1/m\%$.


### Executing CPPI with Drawdown Limitation

The **`CPPI strategy`**, an algorithmic approach, is predicated on three fundamental steps:

- **`Cushion Calculation`**: Derive the cushion by subtracting the Floor value from the Account value.

- **`Asset Allocation`**: Determine the distribution between the risky and safe assets.

- **`Account Value Update`**: Adjust the account value in response to returns.

This segment details the establishment of this investment strategy utilizing industry returns alongside the total market index returns.

```python
# Fetching industry and total market index returns
ind_return = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="rets", nind=nind)
tmi_return = pok.get_total_market_index_returns(nind=nind)
```

The focus is narrowed to industry returns post-2000, concentrating on three industries as the risky assets:

```python
# Selecting industry returns from 2000 for three industries
risky_rets = ind_return["2000":][["Steel","Fin","Beer"]]
```

For the safe asset, an artificial asset is crafted, guaranteeing a $3\%$ annual return:

```python
# Creating a DataFrame for safe asset returns with a fixed 3% annual return
safe_rets    = pd.DataFrame().reindex_like(risky_rets)
safe_rets[:] = 0.03 / 12
```

Initial account value (investment), floor value, and multiplier are then established:

```python
# Setting initial values and parameters for the CPPI strategy
start_value   = 1000  # Initial investment
account_value = start_value  # Current account value
floor         = 0.8  # Floor as a percentage of the initial account value
floor_value   = floor * account_value  # Absolute floor value
m = 3  # Multiplier, selected based on acceptable drop before breaching the floor

# Initializing DataFrames to track account history, cushion, and risky asset weights
account_history = pd.DataFrame().reindex_like(risky_rets)
cushion_history = pd.DataFrame().reindex_like(risky_rets)
risky_w_history = pd.DataFrame().reindex_like(risky_rets)
```

Prior to initiating the CPPI strategy, the growth of wealth exclusively invested in risky assets is computed for comparison:

```python
# Calculating the wealth growth for a 100% investment in risky assets
risky_wealth = start_value * (1 + risky_rets).cumprod()
print(risky_wealth.head())
```

The CPPI strategy is now executed:

```python
Copy code
# Implementing the CPPI strategy over time
for step in range(len(risky_rets.index)):
    # Calculating the cushion as a percentage of the current account value
    cushion = (account_value - floor_value) / account_value
    
    # Determining the allocation to the risky asset, ensuring it stays within [0,1]
    risky_w = m * cushion
    risky_w = np.minimum(risky_w, 1)
    risky_w = np.maximum(risky_w, 0)
    
    # Determining the allocation to the safe asset
    safe_w  = 1 - risky_w
    
    # Calculating the value allocation to both the risky and safe assets
    risky_allocation = risky_w * account_value
    safe_allocation  = safe_w  * account_value
    
    # Updating the account value based on returns from both assets
    account_value = risky_allocation * (1 + risky_rets.iloc[step] ) + safe_allocation  * (1 + safe_rets.iloc[step]  )
        
    # Recording the current account value, cushion, and risky asset weights
    account_history.iloc[step] = account_value
    cushion_history.iloc[step] = cushion 
    risky_w_history.iloc[step] = risky_w

# Calculating the returns from the CPPI strategy
cppi_rets = (account_history / account_history.shift(1) - 1).dropna()
```

The account history resultant from the CPPI strategy is then examined:

```python
# Plotting the account history to visualize the wealth evolution over time
ax = account_history.plot(figsize=(10,5), grid=True)
ax.set_ylabel("wealth ($)")
plt.show()
```

A comparative analysis between the CPPI strategies and a full investment in risky assets is conducted:

```python
# Setting up the plot for comparative analysis between CPPI strategies and full investment in risky assets
fig, ax = plt.subplots(3,2,figsize=(18,15))
ax = ax.flatten()

# Comparative analysis for 'Beer'
account_history["Beer"].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, label="CPPI Beer")
risky_wealth["Beer"].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, label="Beer", style="k:")
ax[0].axhline(y=floor_value, color="r", linestyle="--", label="Fixed floor value")
ax[0].legend(fontsize=11)

# Plotting the allocation weights for 'Beer'
risky_w_history["Beer"].plot(ax=ax[1], grid=True, label="Risky weight in Beer")
ax[1].legend(fontsize=11)

# Comparative analysis for 'Fin'
account_history["Fin"].plot(ax=ax[2], grid=True, label="CPPI Fin")
risky_wealth["Fin"].plot(ax=ax[2], grid=True, label="Fin", style="k:")
ax[2].axhline(y=floor_value, color="r", linestyle="--", label="Fixed floor value")
ax[2].legend(fontsize=11)

# Plotting the allocation weights for 'Fin'
risky_w_history["Fin"].plot(ax=ax[3], grid=True, label="Risky weight in Fin")
ax[3].legend(fontsize=11)

# Comparative analysis for 'Steel'
account_history["Steel"].plot(ax=ax[4], grid=True, label="CPPI Steel")
risky_wealth["Steel"].plot(ax=ax[4], grid=True, label="Steel", style="k:")
ax[4].axhline(y=floor_value, color="r", linestyle="--", label="Fixed floor value")
ax[4].legend(fontsize=11)

# Plotting the allocation weights for 'Steel'
risky_w_history["Steel"].plot(ax=ax[5], grid=True, label="Risky weight in Steel")
ax[5].legend(fontsize=11)

plt.show()
```

As anticipated, during periods of market growth, the CPPI strategy (blue line) typically underperforms a full investment in the risky asset (dotted line). However, the CPPI strategy demonstrates its value during downturns, such as the Lehman Brothers crisis, where it protects the investment from breaching the floor.

Lastly, the statistics for both a pure investment in risky assets and the CPPI strategy are compared:

```python
# Displaying summary statistics for the pure risky asset investment and the CPPI strategy
print(pok.summary_stats(risky_rets))
print(pok.summary_stats(cppi_rets))
```

Drawdown analysis reveals that while a full investment in risky assets might lead to greater losses, it may also yield higher returns. For instance, investing entirely in **`Beer`** might have returned approximately $8\%$ annually, compared to around $7\%$ from the **`CPPI strategy`**.

### Implementing the Dynamic Drawdown Constraint

In the initial CPPI strategy, the floor value was static.

However, investors typically prefer a strategy where the **`floor value is dynamically updated based on the portfolio's wealth growth`**, specifically relative to the **`previous peak`**. This approach aims to recalibrate the floor value as the portfolio value increases.

The CPPI strategy has been encapsulated into a method within the toolkit. This version incorporates a dynamic drawdown constraint, where the multiplier $m$ is adjusted based on the specified drawdown limit.

Consider an example with a drawdown limit of $20\%$:

```python
# Running the CPPI with a dynamic drawdown constraint using the toolkit's method
res = pok.cppi(risky_rets, start_value=1000, floor=0.8, drawdown=0.2, risk_free_rate=0.03, periods_per_year=12)

# Selecting a specific sector for analysis
sector = "Fin"

# Plotting the wealth progression of the CPPI strategy alongside the pure investment in the sector and the floor value
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,4))
ax = ax.flatten()

# Plotting the CPPI wealth and the risky wealth for the selected sector
res["CPPI wealth"][sector].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, label="CPPI "+sector)
res["Risky wealth"][sector].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, label=sector, style="k:")
res["Floor value"][sector].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, color="r", linestyle="--", label="Dynamic floor value")
ax[0].legend(fontsize=11)

# Plotting the allocation to the risky asset over time
res["Risky allocation"][sector].plot(ax=ax[1], grid=True, label="Risky weight in "+sector)
ax[1].legend(fontsize=11)

plt.show()
```

This code executes the CPPI strategy with a dynamic floor that adapts based on the portfolio's performance and imposes a drawdown constraint.

Next, compare the statistics of the sector's pure risky returns with the returns from the CPPI strategy:

```python
# Displaying the summary statistics for the sector's pure risky returns and the CPPI returns
print("Statistics for sector's pure risky returns:")
print(tabulate(pok.summary_stats(risky_rets[sector]), headers='keys', tablefmt='github'))

print("\nStatistics for CPPI returns:")
print(tabulate(pok.summary_stats(res["CPPI returns"][sector]), headers='keys', tablefmt='github'))
```

The maximum drawdown in the CPPI strategy is expected to be around $19.8\%$ with an annual return of $6\%$. The dynamic adjustment of the multiplier $m$ based on the drawdown constraint ensures that the investment floor is protected during market downturns.

Now, observe the behavior of the CPPI strategy when varying the maximum accepted drawdown:

```python
# Comparing CPPI strategies with different drawdown constraints
sector = "Fin"
drawdowns = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
    
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,4))
ax = ax.flatten()

# Plotting the risky wealth for comparison
res["Risky wealth"][sector].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, style="k:", label=sector)
ax[0].legend()

# Initializing a DataFrame to store summary statistics
summ = pd.DataFrame()

# Analyzing CPPI strategies with various drawdown constraints
for drawdown in drawdowns:
    # Running CPPI with the specified drawdown constraint
    res = pok.cppi(risky_rets, start_value=1000, floor=0.8, drawdown=drawdown, risk_free_rate=0.03, periods_per_year=12)    
    
    # Plotting the CPPI wealth and risky allocation for each drawdown scenario
    res["CPPI wealth"][sector].plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, label="CPPI dd={}%, m={}".format(drawdown*100,round(res["m"],1)) )
    res["Risky allocation"][sector].plot(ax=ax[1], grid=True, label="dd={}%, m={}".format(drawdown*100,round(res["m"],1)) )
    
    # Appending summary statistics for each scenario
    summ = pd.concat([summ, pok.summary_stats(res["CPPI returns"][sector])], axis=0)
        
# Displaying the plots and summary statistics
ax[0].legend() 
ax[1].legend(fontsize=11)
ax[1].set_title("Risky weight", fontsize=11)
plt.show()

# Setting the index for the summary statistics DataFrame
summ.index = [["DD20%","DD40%","DD60%"]]
print("Summary statistics for various drawdown scenarios:")
print(tabulate(summ, headers='keys', tablefmt='github'))
```

This code compares the performance and allocation strategy of the CPPI strategy under different drawdown constraints, illustrating how the strategy adapts to various levels of risk tolerance. The summary statistics provide insight into the trade-offs between risk and return for each scenario.

## Generating Random Walks with Geometric Brownian Motion

### Wiener Process Overview

A Wiener process $W_t$ is a continuous-time stochastic process defined by four key characteristics:

1. The process starts at zero: $W_{0}=0$;
2. It has independent increments, meaning future changes $W_{t+u}-W_{t}$, for $u\geq 0$, are independent of past values $W_{s}$, for $s< t$;
3. Has Gaussian increments, meaning increments following a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $u$ , i.e., $W_{t+u}-W_t \sim{\mathcal {N}}(0,u)$;
4. The process has continuous paths, implying $W_{t}$ varies smoothly over time.

Therefore, $\mathbb{E}[W_t]=0$, $\text{Var}(W_t) = t$ for a fixed time $t$ and the unconditional probability density function of $W_t$ is:

$$
f_{W_{t}}(x) = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi t} } e^{\frac{-x^2}{2t}}.
$$

### Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

A **`stochastic process`** $S_t$ follows a **`Geometric Brownian Motion`** if it adheres to the following **`stochastic differential equation (SDE)`**:

$$
dS_{t} = \mu S_{t}\,dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_{t} 
$$

where $W_{t}$ is a **`Brownian motion`** (i.e. a **`Wiener process`**), $\mu$ represents the **`drift`** (trend), and $\sigma$ represents the **`volatility`**. Both are constants.

#### Returns and Log-Returns

By dividing the equation by $S_t$ and $dt$, one can derive a formula for generating percentage returns from a GBM. The returns generated this way have a mean of $\mu dt$ and volatility of $\sigma \sqrt{dt}$.

> 📢 **Remark**
>
> In the given equation, $dS_t = S_{t+dt} - S_t$, and similarly $dW_t = W_{t+dt} - W_t$ for $dt>0$. When this is normalized by $S_t$ the formula becomes:
>
> $$
\frac{S_{t+dt} - S_t}{S_t} = \mu dt + \sigma (W_{t+dt} - W_t).
> $$
>

#### Log-Returns and Price Evolution

For log-returns, approximations using Taylor series expansions lead to:

$$
\log\left(\frac{S_{t+dt}}{S_t}\right) \approx \left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)dt + \sigma\sqrt{dt}\xi_t,
$$

where $\xi_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. This simplifies the calculation of prices and returns over time.

The price evolution of a stock, for example, can be modeled using the GBM formula:

$$
S_t = S_0\exp\left(\left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t + \sigma W_t\right).
$$

Within the toolkit, there are two functions that generate stock prices based on the above principles: one by compounding percentage returns following a GBM and another by resolving the GBM equation for log-returns:

```python
prices_1, rets_1 = pok.simulate_gbm_from_returns(n_years=10, n_scenarios=10, mu=0.07, sigma=0.15, periods_per_year=12, start=100.0)
prices_2, rets_2 = pok.simulate_gbm_from_prices(n_years=10, n_scenarios=10, mu=0.07, sigma=0.15, periods_per_year=12, start=100.0)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20,5))
prices_1.plot(ax=ax[0], grid=True, title="Prices generated by compounding returns which follow a GBM")
prices_2.plot(ax=ax[1], grid=True, title="Prices generated by solving the GBM equation satisfied by log-returns")
plt.show()
```

Occasionally, the drift $\mu$ in the geometric Brownian motion is decomposed to accentuate the risk-free rate, the volatility, and the Sharpe ratio. Specifically, the Sharpe ratio of a stock index is defined as:

$$
\text{SR} := \lambda = \frac{R_s - R_f}{\sigma} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad R_s = R_f + \sigma \lambda,
$$

where $\sigma$ denotes the stock index's volatility, $R_f$ the risk-free rate, and $R_s$ the stock index's annualized return.

This reveals that $\mu$, representing the expected return of the stock index being modeled, is essentially the risk-free rate $R_f$ plus a risk premium, composed of the unit of risk, i.e., volatility $\sigma$, and the reward per unit of risk, i.e., the Sharpe ratio $\lambda$.

Consequently, the geometric Brownian motion for (percentage) returns with $\mu$ replaced is:

$
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = (R_f + \sigma \lambda) dt + \sigma dW_t.
$
