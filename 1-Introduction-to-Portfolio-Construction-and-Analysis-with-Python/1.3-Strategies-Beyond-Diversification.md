This segment employs Python libraries to illustrate fundamental principles of Portfolio Optimization:

```python
import pandas as pd  # Utilized for data manipulation
import numpy as np  # Employed for numerical computations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Applied for creating visualizations
import scipy.stats  # Engaged for statistical calculations
from pandas_datareader import data  # Used to retrieve financial data
from datetime import datetime  # Essential for managing date and time entities
from scipy.optimize import minimize  # Implemented for conducting optimization tasks
import PortfolioOptimizationKit as pok  # A specialized toolkit dedicated to portfolio optimization

plt.style.use("seaborn-dark")  # Configuring the visual style of plots
```

## Constraints of Portfolio Diversification

- **Elements that diversification successfully addresses**:

  - The approach to augment the reward for each unit of risk;
  - The method to reduce idiosyncratic or specific risk: indeed, it enables investors to diminish specific risks within their portfolios, which is how they can achieve a high reward for each unit of risk.

- **Elements that diversification fails to address**:

  - Diversification is not a viable strategy to reduce systemic risk: essentially, if the entire market collapses, the degree of portfolio diversification becomes irrelevant as correlation levels typically rise and the benefits of diversification diminish.

Subsequently, the intent is to illustrate the aforementioned aspect, specifically that during significant financial downturns, portfolio diversification does not ensure reduced risk.

Proceed to load the subsequent dataset featuring 30 Industry portfolios from Kaggle:

```python
nind = 30

ind_rets   = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="rets", nind=nind)  # Retrieving industry returns
ind_nfirms = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="nfirms", nind=nind)  # Accessing the number of firms per industry
ind_size   = pok.get_ind_file(filetype="size", nind=nind)  # Gathering average industry sizes

ind_rets.head(3)  # Displaying the first three entries of industry returns
```

The **`ind_rets`** dataframe encompasses returns (spanning 1926-2018) of $30$ portfolios covering various industry sectors such as food, beer, smoke, etc.

These portfolios are formulated based on weights corresponding to their market capitalizations.
The **`market capitalization`** of an entity is its **`total valuation`**, calculated as
the product of the company's outstanding share count and the share price
(e.g., if company "A" has 100,000 shares at $20.3 each, its market cap is $2,030,000).

For instance, the **`Food`** column represents the returns of a portfolio comprising all companies within the food sector for each month from 1926 to 2019. Each company is weighted according to its market capitalization within this portfolio.

Next, the **`number of firms`** comprising each individual sector is recorded in **`ind_nfirms`**:

```python
ind_nfirms.head(3)
```

indicating that in July 1926, there were 43 companies in the Food portfolio, 3 in the Beer portfolio, etc.

Lastly, the **`ind_size`** dataframe presents the **`average size`** of the companies within each portfolio:

```python
ind_size.head(3)
```

illustrating that the average size of the 43 Food companies in July 1926 was 35.98, while the average size of the 3 Beer companies was 7.12, and so on (the unit of measurement is arbitrary). Here, **`average size`** refers to the **`mean of the market capitalizations`** of the companies within sectors like Food, Beer, etc.

## Formulating the Index

The initial step is to calculate the **`market capitalization for each industry sector`**.
This is determined by multiplying the number of firms by their average size:

```python
# Calculate the market capitalization for each sector
ind_mkt_cap = ind_nfirms * ind_size
print(ind_mkt_cap.head(3))
```

The next objective is to ascertain the **`total market capitalization`** to derive the proportion of the
total market capitalization attributed to each industry. The total market capitalization
is a singular time series **`indicating the aggregate market value at each month`**.
This is achieved by summing the market capitalization of each sector for every month, i.e.,
by horizontally summing the **`ind_mkt_cap`**:

```python
# Summing across sectors to get the total market capitalization at each time point
total_mkt_cap = ind_mkt_cap.sum(axis=1)
print(total_mkt_cap.head())
```

Then, the proportion of each industry's market cap to the total can be calculated:

```python
# Calculating the weight of each industry's market cap in the total market capitalization
ind_cap_weights = ind_mkt_cap.divide(total_mkt_cap, axis=0)
print(ind_cap_weights.head(3))
```

For instance, in July 1926, the total market capitalization was $\$26,657.94$, with the Food sector comprising approximately $5.8\%$,
the Beer sector approximately $0.08\%$, and so forth.

Visualization of these components is as follows:

```python
# Creating plots to visualize the total market capitalization and the weights of selected sectors over time
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,4)) 
total_mkt_cap.plot(grid=True, ax=ax[0]) 
ax[0].set_title("Total market cap 1929-2018")

ind_cap_weights[["Steel","Fin","Telcm"]].plot(grid=True, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title("Steel, Finance, and Telecommunication Market caps (%) 1929-2018")
plt.show()
```

The left plot displays the total market capitalization from 1929 to 2018. The right plot shows the Steel, Finance, and Telecommunication Market
caps from 1929 to 2018 as a percentage of the total market capitalization.

For instance, observe the change in the Finance sector from about $3%$ of the total market cap in 1929 to over $15%$ in 2018.
Conversely, the Steel sector decreased from around $9%$ in 1929 to $0.2%$ in 2018.

Now, the focus shifts to calculating the **`total market return`**, i.e., the return time series for the total market.
This is the sum of the weighted returns of each sector:

```python
# Calculating the total market return by weighting each sector's monthly returns
total_market_return = (ind_cap_weights * ind_rets).sum(axis=1)

# Assuming an initial investment of 1000$
capital = 1000
# Compounding the returns to get the total market index
total_market_index = capital * (1 + total_market_return).cumprod()

# Visualizing the total market index and returns over time
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,4)) 

total_market_index.plot(grid=True, ax=ax[0]) 
ax[0].set_title("Total market cap-weighted index 1929-2018")

total_market_return.plot(grid=True, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title("Total market cap-weighted returns 1929-2018")

plt.show()
```

Note that the plot of the (cap-weighted) index essentially mirrors the plot of the total market capitalization, albeit with different values.

Finally, the aim is to explore **`the relationship between returns and market correlations`**.
